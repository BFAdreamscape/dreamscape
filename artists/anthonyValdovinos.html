      <p>Ardent creator Tony Valdo, born Anthony Cristian Valdovinos, calls himself an aspiring Anthropologist, self proclaimed whisperer of systems, and soon to be certificated Digital Media Artist (second in his family to graduate college). Often thought are the points in time of first contact between alien cultures, and the time of today in a diverse society, depicting the anthropocene from an artistic perspective. In this digital realm, he commemorates the Native and Spanish influences behind his practice using concepts from his collaborations in art using digital systems which has been a hard earned privilege for him as a Calfornia Student, but more importantly with his experience as a 1st generation Mexican-American living between two cultural worlds in simultaneous transition through the digital era.  His ongoing research and  timeline development conjoining American colonization with Industrial Revolutions has led to a discovery of his Purepecha Ancestry.<br><br>The guides he welcomes often influence a hand and allow him to find inspiration at the right time. One such inspiration came after reading a book called “Fabulous Beasts and Demons”  by Heinz Adolf Mode, which affirmed his belief in the power of the number 2, thus launching his new career endeavor in a creative, multi-industry collective coined The Purple Project. On this journey as an American artist located and thriving on Ohlone Land, he’s perceptive of the active atmosphere over the land, which he knows his late grandmother, the Matriarch of success, has certainly riled up from under a giant oak tree, as she would rile up her grandkids to show her collection of animal miniatures or a weapon that could protect the house and all its children from those who dared.
      <br><br>Tony’s designs are memorial and his creative flows sometimes whisper truths to power and principle, such as manifest destiny, which forced many souls into the middle realm through unnatural selection; a cloudy portal through which you can explore here as an alternate world where all things lost may thrive beyond unexpectation. Did you know that before this region was founded as the Silicon Valley, it was thought to be an Island of California?  The Guides  on the shore are pleased to meet you in their backwards dreamscape. Welcome to Nuve Nacirema….Ah Paradise.
