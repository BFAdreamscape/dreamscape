### Dreamscape Exhibition Description:
Rather than focusing on what is not possible during this time of uncertainty, Dreamscape emphasizes the potential for the emergence of new and diverse ideas as we adapt to the global pandemic.

Though the work is diverse in many ways, all projects are a testament to our capacity to overcome obstacles and dream of new ways-of-being. Our projects consist of a variety of topics which include identity, social issues, mental health, and much more. Some of the mediums our projects encompass are data visualization, visual and auditory experience, digital paintings, digital video, virtual space, game, and web art.
